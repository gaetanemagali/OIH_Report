# OIH_Report
This GitHub repository contains all codes and documentation created for targeting microbes in the digital ecosystems of ODIS and OBIS. This work was done in the context of a short Masters project of Marmic - Max Planck School of Marine Microbiology, for UNESCO and the UN Ocean Decade variable.


# Project Documentation

The full report is located in the file [Full_Report.pdf](./Full_Report.pdf).

The developed OBIS graph is labelled as [OBIS_graph.pdf](./OBIS_graph.pdf).

The code snippets are organized according to workflow steps:

1. **Step 1: Harvesting microbial data**
   - [1. Harvesting microbial data](./1.%20Harvesting%20microbial%20data/)

2. **Step 2: Targeting data landscape**
   - [2. Targeting data landscape](./2.%20Targeting%20data%20landscape/)

3. **Step 3: Building Graph**
   - [3. Building Graph](./3.%20Building%20Graph/)
